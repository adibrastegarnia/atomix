# [Atomix](https://atomix.io)

Atomix is a cloud native runtime for building stateful, scalable, configurable, and reliable distributed 
applications in Kubernetes. The Atomix API provides a set of high-level building blocks (referred to as distributed 
primitives) for building distributed systems. The architecture of Atomix incorporates the lessons learned from 
experience over the past decade building high-availability cloud infrastructure. The primary focus of the project 
is to decouple applications from specific data stores, instead providing a set of unified, polyglot interfaces 
(gRPC services) to a variety of systems and protocols, and enabling rapid experimentation and customization of 
distributed applications.
